				<h1>Political Opinion</h1>
				<h4>Kemalism</h4>
				<p>The Ottoman Empire lost most of its lands with the effect of the French Revolution and the collapse after the First World War. Only the Anatolian lands remained in the hands of the Turks, but the imperial powers began to occupy Anatolia to collect off their debts from the Ottoman Empire, the Turks fought a 5-year war of independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal.</p>
				<p>After the war, Mustafa Kemal became the president as the national leader, now the ropes were in his hands, the Turkish people obeyed him indifferently, except of course, the rebellions that were tried to be started with British funding.(For Example : Sheikh Said rebellion)</p>
				<p>Mustafa Kemal established a new republican regime by taking his country, which lagged behind Europe, as an example to western countries and adopting the contemporary values ​​of the west.</p>
				<p>Sultanate and Caliphate were abolished. Instead of the Ottoman letters mixed with Arabic and Persian, he introduced the plain Turkish Latin alphabet to the people. State made modern dressing a necessity to people. State recognized the right to vote and be elected very early for women, unlike western countries.</p>
				<p>Mustafa Kemal's ideas spread among the peasants over time and the people began to refer to his ideas as Kemalism. Mustafa Kemal reinforced his legitimacy in the eyes of the people by taking the surname Atatürk.(Meaning: Father of Turks)</p>
				<p>The 6 basic principles of Kemalism are: Republicism, Secularism, Populism, Nationalism, Etatism and Reformism.</p>
				<p>Thanks to Kemalism, industrialization began in Turkey, Turkey became one of the few countries that produced and exported its own aircraft, Village institutes; which would be closed with the directives of the United States in the future, were established, and the practice of modern agriculture was encouraged.</p>
				<p>The variant of Kemalism advocated by Hamza; <br>
				It defines the state as the dominant and decision-making mechanism in every field, and it is an inseparable idea from Atatürk's principles and reforms. It was implemented between 1923-1946 in one-party period.</p>
				<h4>Militarism</h4>
				<p>It is based on the fact that the Turkish Army is "always  be ready for war and dangerous situations", therefore it Individual armament ​and strives to keep Kuvâ-yi Milliye alive</p>
				<p>advocates that the Kemalist tutelage take over the administration of the country in case the government fails during the internal conflict and war in the country.</p>
				<h4>National Pact Goals</h4>
				<p>Turkey's claim of right on the occupied lands, which was lost with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and which sheltered the Turks, in line with this claim;
				"Western Thrace, Dodecanese Islands, Cyprus, Batumi, Deyr-i Zor, Aleppo and Mosul" Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, in order to save from the occupation, said; "If God grants me and my life is faithful, I will take back Mosul, Kirkuk and the Islands. I will add Western Thrace, including Thessaloniki, to Turkey."</p>
				<h4>Opposing Views</h4>
				<p>Anti-Imperialism: The current of skepticism towards the western imperialist nations that have fought with Turkey in the past expresses the following briefly: "Even if we forget them, they will not forget that we are Turks."</p>
				<p>Anti-Nato:In connection with the above principle of anti-imperialism;"There is no one country with a profit outside of American imperialism."It is absurd to unite under Nato Alliance with western countries that shed the blood of our grandfahers and whichare constantly involved in our internal affairs and are malicious against us.</p>
				<p>Anti-Reactionary:All reactionary threats aimed at Ataturk's principles and revolutions at home and abroad should be eliminated quickly, since they are more dangerous than the PKK..</p>
