Only the Anatolian lands remained in the hands of the Turks, but the imperial powers began to occupy Anatolia to collect off their debts from the Ottoman Empire, the Turks fought a 5-year war of independence under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal.</p>
				<p>After the war, Mustafa Kemal became the president as the national leader, now the ropes were in his hands, the Turkish people obeyed him indifferently, except of course, the rebellions that were tried to be started with British funding.(For Example : Sheikh Said rebellion)</p>
				<p>Mustafa Kemal established a new republican regime by taking his country, which lagged behind Europe, as an example to western countries and adopting the contemporary values ​​of the west.</p>
				<p>Sultanate and Caliphate were abolished. Instead of the Ottoman letters mixed with Arabic and Persian, he introduced the plain Turkish Latin alphabet to the people. State made modern dressing a necessity to people. State recognized the right to vote and be elected very early for women, unlike western countries.</p>
				<p>Mustafa Kemal's ideas spread among the peasants over time and the people began to refer to his ideas as Kemalism. Mustafa Kemal reinforced his legitimacy in the eyes of the people by taking the surname Atatürk.(Meaning: Father of Turks)</p>
				<p>The 6 basic principles of Kemalism are: Republicism, Secularism, Populism, Nationalism, Etatism and Reformism.</p>
